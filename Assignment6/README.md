Autograd in python and CNN applications and practice (kera, pytorch and pytorch lightning implemenations)
-

Part A: 
* Implement complete autograd framework in numpy and mnist classifier using the autograd framework.

Part B:
* Build an CNN based image classifier (at least 3 - 5 categories) from a custom data set you acquire (either from images.google.com or other places
* Implement in both keras as well as pytorch lightning - 2 colabs
